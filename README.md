# nn
A simple framework(-ish) for making a neural network.

Main has a test that just uses mnist. Gets about 96% accuracy with a kind of simple randomly chosen network. 

Todo:
    - implement ensemble of nets.
    - save and load trained network. 
    - test (and probably fix) conv2d. 
    - parallelize stuff.
    - batch normalization (maybe, I think this is hard to do...)
    - Adam optimizer.
