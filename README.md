# nn
implementation of a neural network. Trying to make it somewhat flexible so it works like a framework.

Can be used to make network. Only supports the normal dense/fully connected layer and relu right now. 

need to add support for more types of layers -> convolution, dropout, maybe batch normalization. 

Main has a really simple test right now that just tells if an input number is positive or negative.
